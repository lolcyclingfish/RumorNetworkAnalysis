## Progress
1. Transforming the data into usable format.
2. Creating keys of fake (source, destination) pairs in order to ensure class imbalance.
  *Still needs attributes for these fake pairs.*
3. Adding local centralities (degree, eigen, closeness, between) from both fake and real news networks for both source and destination, so we know each website's respective position in both networks.
4. Included mutuality, Jaccard coeff and common neighbors (all, in, out) as features. Trained classification model and obtain (unsatisfactory) preliminary results.

## To-do list
