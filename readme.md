## Progress
1. Transforming the data into usable format.
2. Creating keys of fake (source, destination) pairs in order to ensure class imbalance.
  *Still needs attributes for these fake pairs.*
3. Adding local centralities (degree, eigen, closeness, between) from both fake and real news networks for both source and destination, so we know each website's respective position in both networks.

## To-do list
